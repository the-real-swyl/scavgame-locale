# Contributing to the Locales

We welcome contributions to the localization files! Make sure you are in touch with the community on the [discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/955738554129063947/1298240970764324914).
Different threads are available for different languages. Here are some guidelines to help you get started:

1. [Repository Structure](#repository-structure)
2. [Guidelines for Editing Localization Files](#guidelines-for-editing-localization-files)
3. [Getting Started](#getting-started)
4. [Pull Request Guide](#pull-request-guide)

## Repository Structure

You will find the localization files in the root directory. The reference locale is `EN.json` (English). Each language has its own json file named according to its locale code, where the first two letters represent the language, and the capitalized ones the country (e.g., `pt-BR.json` for Brazilian Portuguese `es-ES.json` for Spain Spanish).

## Guidelines for Editing Localization Files

1. Do **not** edit:

   -  The `EN.json` (English) locale file, as it serves as the reference for all other locales. Should you correct a typo present in the reference, it should berforehand be discussed with @Orsoniks.

2. While translating in json files:

   - **Never change keys** in the JSON (the left-hand identifiers). Only change values.
   - **Preserve placeholders exactly**: `<>`, `<1>`, `<color=\"grey\">`, `<limb>` etc.
   - **Keep sentence meaning**: do not invent or remove context.
   - **Spacing/punctuation**: apply normal rules but be consistent with the project style.
   - **Short strings caution**: game UI may truncate very long text. Prefer translations with the approximate same amount of characters where possible, particularly with UI text.
   - **Keep the json entries sorted** similarly to the reference locale (`EN.json`).
   - Don't try to '*improve*' the game, just make it your language.

3. Use a text editor or IDE that supports JSON formatting and validation to avoid syntax errors (avoid editing within GitHub as an example).

4. **Avoid using automatic translation tools**. They tend to fail to capture context accurately, and their usage is strongly frowned upon both in the community, and under the [Volunteer Translator License Agreement](../LICENSE.md).

5. We recommend soliciting help from the community if you need help with translating specific terms or phrases. The [discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/955738554129063947/1298240970764324914) is for all general locale discussions, but use the specific threads for your language if available.

## Getting Started

### Existing Locales

> But there is already a locale for my language!

Great! Your insights and contributions are still very welcome. You can help by:

- **Getting in touch with the locale's team on the [discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/955738554129063947/1298240970764324914)**, that way they can tell you where your help’s needed most.

- **Reviewing and improving existing translations**: Even if the locale is present, it does not necessarly mean it is finalized. Translations only worked on by one person deserve to be proofread and revised. Also, if the `EN.json` file is more recent than a locale file, it usually means that it is outdated and changes need to be brought to the locale.

### Creating a New Locale

> There is no locale for my language yet!

If you have read the guidelines and are ready to start translating, you can create a new locale by :

- **Getting in touch with the community on the [discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/955738554129063947/1298240970764324914)**, to see if others are interested in helping you or are already working on it.

- Creating a fork of this repository.

- Adding your new locale file, committing regularly to save your progression on your side.

- Credit yourself, your potential co-tranlators and register your locale with a new line in the `README.md`.

- Creating a pull request (PR) on the main repository.

> You should NEVER feel pressured to have a complete locale. Even partial contributions are valuable and appreciated! Also, you should not pressure others to contribute. Everyone contributes in their own time and way.

## Pull Request Guide

Make sure your pull request follows these rules to increase speed and chances of approval:

1. The locale file must be **fully up-to-date with `EN.json`**.
   - No lines may be missing (missing entries cause display errors).
   - If submitting a partial translation, keep untranslated lines in **English**.

2. When updating an existing locale, **use the current translation as a base**.
   - Add any new keys introduced in `EN.json`.
   - Only rewrite everything if the translation is severely outdated (>1 year) or clearly low quality.

3. Translations must be reviewed and approved by **at least one native speaker** of the target language. Two heads are better than one!

4. Credit yourself and any co-translators, and add make sure your locale is present in `README.md`.

5. Also credit yourself and any co-traslators within the `description` field of the locale file. This will be displayed in the game's language selection screen.

6. Add a descriptive message to your pull request.
